"""The cabmap browser's whole model, with no widgets in it: the columnar row
table, the pythonnet bridge session, the virtual-folder-tree navigation state,
and search/sort/selection bookkeeping.

Deliberately NOT the host's own model type -- not a bpy CollectionProperty, not
a Qt model. At real-world cabmap scale (~260k rows for Endfield 1.3.3, confirmed
against the real game) materializing every row into host objects is itself the
bottleneck: RNA allocation per element, .blend/undo bloat and O(n) mutation cost
on the Blender side, widget-item churn on the Qt side. Exactly why the WinForms
browser this one mirrors used VirtualMode plus a plain backing list. Each host's
panel materializes only ``display_window()`` -- a capped, already-filtered
window -- and nothing else.

The one thing that stays with the host is the search DEBOUNCE TIMER, because
that is a UI event loop's job (``bpy.app.timers`` / ``QTimer``); the policy
constant it needs (SEARCH_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS) and the work it triggers
(``reapply_filter``) are both here.

    the SAME instance forever after, ignoring hook_ids on every later call. A cabmap "Build"/
    "Load" done with zero (or a since-corrected) hook selection -- e.g. before a hook the user

    with no VFS game hook wired up. Re-ticking the checkbox and rebuilding/reloading the cabmap
    never fixed it: this function kept handing back the same broken session, and downstream
    scene-tab operators read cabmap_state.BRIDGE directly rather than calling ensure_bridge
    themselves, so they inherited the poisoning with no path to recover short of restarting the
    application. Symptom: "Discover maps failed: InvalidOperationException:
    No VFS game hook active" even with the right hook checked.
    Fix: re-apply the current hook_ids via RipperBridge.reinitialize() whenever they differ from

    for why this is safe (RuriHook.ApplyHooks is a diff against the currently active hook set, so
