"""The cabmap browser's whole model, with no widgets in it: the columnar row
table, the pythonnet bridge session, the virtual-folder-tree navigation state,
and search/sort/selection bookkeeping.

Deliberately NOT the host's own model type -- not a bpy CollectionProperty, not
a Qt model. At real-world cabmap scale (~260k rows for Endfield 1.3.3, confirmed
against the real game) materializing every row into host objects is itself the
bottleneck: RNA allocation per element, .blend/undo bloat and O(n) mutation cost
on the Blender side, widget-item churn on the Qt side. Exactly why the WinForms
browser this one mirrors used VirtualMode plus a plain backing list. Each host's
panel materializes only ``display_window()`` -- a capped, already-filtered
window -- and nothing else.

Per INSTALL, one session. All of that per-cabmap state (rows, folder tree,
selection, sort, filter, the animation-build handover) lives on a GameSession,
one per install key, so several installs' cabmaps can be open at once and
switched between without either one throwing the other away -- a CabMapHandle is
a pure value object and the bridge holds many (see pythonnet_bridge.use_session).
``activate`` picks the live one; the module-level session-field names (ROWS,
VISIBLE, CURRENT_DIR, ...) are a read/write VIEW onto whichever session is active,
proxied through __getattr__/set_select_anchor so every existing
``cabmap_state.ROWS`` reader sees the active install with no change. The ONE thing
that is genuinely process-wide and shared is BRIDGE, the CLR session itself.

The one thing that stays with the host is the search DEBOUNCE TIMER, because
that is a UI event loop's job (``bpy.app.timers`` / ``QTimer``); the policy
constant it needs (SEARCH_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS) and the work it triggers
(``reapply_filter``) are both here.

    disagree with -- the same trap leaf_name_in_current_dir already
    documents and works around for the folder-browse view; a flat
    search-result row needs the equivalent fix, or jumping from a match that
    only exists on path 1+ lands in path 0's unrelated folder instead (e.g.
    an animation-CAB path when the row actually matched on a dynamicassets
    path -- confirmed report).

    - Folder-browse view (query blank -- no active search text): the path
      whose folder segments equal CURRENT_DIR, i.e. the SAME identity the
      row is already being displayed under (browse_dir already put you
      there, so this normally resolves back to a no-op).
    - Flat search-result view (query non-blank): the first path containing
      the search text -- the one the row actually matched on.
    - Falls back to path 0 when neither applies (e.g. the row matched via a
      different field -- Type/Source -- or purely through an Include/Exclude
      rule with no plain search text typed)."""
