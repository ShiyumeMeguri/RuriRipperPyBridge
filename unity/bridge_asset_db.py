"""Bridge-mode AssetDatabase: resolves guids against an in-memory pythonnet
closure (RipperBlenderBridge.ImportCabs' single guid -> bytes Assets dict)
instead of scanning a directory of .meta files. Same duck-typed surface as
asset_db.AssetDatabase (load_guid, load_file, resolve_guid, resolve_ref), plus
texture_bytes/all_guids/clip_curves for the bridge-only callers -- every consumer
that sticks to the shared surface (hierarchy, mesh_decoder, prefab, material,
and each host's own mesh/material builders) works unchanged against either
database, which is what lets one importer serve both a folder of extracted
YAML and a live cabmap closure.

The closure hands over one dict of raw bytes and nothing else: the bridge does
not sort payloads by kind, because the caller asking for a guid already knows
whether it wants YAML or an image. Decoding therefore happens here, on demand,
and an exporter that starts writing TGA or EXR where it used to write PNG needs
no change on either side of the bridge.
