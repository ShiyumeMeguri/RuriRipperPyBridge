"""Bridge-mode AssetDatabase: resolves guids against an in-memory pythonnet
closure (RipperBlenderBridge.ImportCabs' Documents/Textures dicts) instead of
scanning a directory of .meta files. Same duck-typed surface as
asset_db.AssetDatabase (load_guid, load_file, resolve_guid, resolve_ref), plus
png_bytes/all_guids/clip_curves for the bridge-only callers -- every consumer
that sticks to the shared surface (hierarchy, mesh_decoder, prefab, material,
and each host's own mesh/material builders) works unchanged against either
database, which is what lets one importer serve both a folder of extracted
YAML and a live cabmap closure.
