"""Closure-wide discovery: finding assets by class and name across a database.

A resolved cabmap closure is a flat bag of guid -> YAML text with no index of
its own, and some of those documents are enormous (a dense AnimationClip runs
past 100MB). Everything here is therefore built on ``peek_class_and_name``, a
bounded-prefix sniff rather than a parse, so scanning a whole closure costs
O(number of documents) instead of O(total closure bytes).

Works against either database (disk or bridge closure) -- both expose
``all_guids`` / ``raw_text`` / ``load_guid``.
