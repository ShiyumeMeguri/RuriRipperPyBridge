"""Re-anchoring an AnimationClip's curve bindings onto a real skeleton.

Two independent problems, one join key:

* **Hashed paths.** When the rig wasn't in the export scope, AssetRipper cannot
  restore a curve's binding to a transform-path string and writes the raw Unity
  binding hash instead: ``path_0x<CRC32>_<random>``. The hash is CRC32 of the
  UTF-8 path -- verified empirically against the real game
  (``crc32(b"Root") == 0xB6C65665``, matching its ``path_0xB6C65665_WvpMuNH``
  placeholder exactly, across every probe).
* **Different nesting depth.** Unity hashes the path RELATIVE to the Animator's
  own node, while an imported armature records paths from the prefab ROOT, and
  model variants nest the rig at different depths (confirmed against the real
  game: a uimodel's clip paths start ``Root/Bip001/...`` while a postmodel
  armature stamps ``chr_0013_aglina_postmodel/.../Root/Bip001/...``). Whole-path
  equality -- and whole-path CRC -- therefore never matches across variants.

Both are solved by hashing every SUFFIX of every armature path, so the join is
prefix-agnostic while remaining exact path-structure identity: the same segments
Unity itself hashed, just re-anchored. This is not display-name guessing.

``clip`` throughout is a ``clip_curves.ClipCurves`` (the zero-parse blob
payload or the regex disk parser's output) -- the one canonical clip form.
