"""In-process pythonnet bridge into Ruri.RipperHook.dll: boots a CoreCLR runtime
inside the host application's own process (``bootstrap`` having already
installed pythonnet) and exposes thin Python wrappers over
Ruri.RipperHook.Bridge.RipperBlenderBridge. Everything crossing the CLR/Python
boundary out of this module is plain data (str/bytes/dict/list) -- nothing above
it ever touches `clr`/.NET objects directly, which is what keeps the bridge one
implementation rather than one per host.

The bin dir -- the folder that has to contain BOTH Ruri.RipperHook.dll and
Ruri.RipperHook.CLI.runtimeconfig.json, typically
``<checkout>/AssetRipper/Source/0Bins/AssetRipper/Release`` -- is the one genuinely
machine-specific value here. No repo-root-relative derivation, no
configuration guessing, nothing hardcoded: it is resolved, in order, from

1. ``set_bin_dir(path)`` -- what the host pushed in (Blender: its
   AddonPreferences; Painter: its settings file), which is the normal case;
2. ``set_bin_dir_provider(fn)`` -- a callable, for a host whose preference can
   change under it and would rather be asked than have to remember to push;
3. ``$RURI_RIPPERHOOK_BIN`` -- the headless/CLI escape hatch, no UI needed.
